On this game night we had five knights convene at Garrett's house to do some classic trading in the Mediterranean.  [Medici](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46/medici) is an auction game of goods, gold, and florins.  You play over three rounds with each player putting up lots of merchandise to be purchased.  The auction is once round the table with the auctioneer making the last bid.

The trick is to collect well in a few of the commodities and not spread yourself to thin while also making sure the other players are paying their "fair share".  The balancing act comes in when you make bids to make people pay, while also trying to not get stuck with those goods that will not help you.

Eric managed to monopolize two goods cloth and grains during this game catapulting him to the win.  I was spread a little too thin being invested in 4 out of 5 of the goods is not ideal in this game,  but still managed a tie for second by paying very little for those goods I did purchase.  Garrett was heavily invested in furs while his modest investment in dyes did land him in second in that commodity.  Scott won dyes and tied in spices for first with Chris.  Chris was brand new to the game and manged to score more then 50 florins, well done.
