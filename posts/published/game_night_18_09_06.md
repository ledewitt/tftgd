On this game night the group played [London(Second Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/236191/london-second-edition) a 2017 release from Osprey Games which reimplements the 2010 release from the defunct publisher Treefrog Games.  The players are rebuilding London after the great fire of 1666 through the arc of history up to the twentieth century.

This is a card tableau, engine building game.  However the engine that the players build to run, for the most part eats itself after being used.  The players then build a new engine to run again.  The size of the engine you build determines how much it will cost to run in an abstract way tracked by poverty tokens.
