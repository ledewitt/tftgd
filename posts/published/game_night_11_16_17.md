For the last game night of the year, five knights convened for a night of auctioning and bribery on the African Island of Cape Verde Santiago.  Every round starts with the players bidding on the pecking order to pick from the 5 possible crops to plant in the not so fertile land of Santiago.  The second part of the round is bribing the current Canal Overseerer so that those crops won above can be watered and yield their bounty at harvest which is the end game scoring.  If crops arenâ€™t watered they will be turned back into desert and that plot of land cannot be cultivated again.

  Santiago is really a good game for a short game night.  There is plenty of player interaction, wheeling and dealing.  With not enough water to go around some crops are going to go fallow you just hope not yours.  In the end Nate negotiated himself into the winning position, well done sir.

  There was enough time after the game to discuss it, enjoy some dessert, and then get in a couple rounds of The Great Dalmuti.  Nate finished his sweep of the night.

  Thank you everyone again for attending the Game Nights.  I hope that your Holidays and New Year are filled with family and joy.  Garrett and I will be starting up Game Nights again in late January or February next year.  I will also try to post the missing recaps to get them rounded out for the year.  So watch this distribution list for all that, until next time my all your dice come up sixes.
