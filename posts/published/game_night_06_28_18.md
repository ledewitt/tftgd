On this game night, five game knights found themselves digging in the ground for gold during the California gold rush.  [Fool's Gold](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132758/fools-gold) is a game by Joshua Balvin about finding gold in them there hills, specifically the Sierra Nevada gold fields in the years of 1849 to 1853.

In this game there are five mines that the players will try to wring as much gold from as possible.  These mines in game terms are decks of cards; each mine/deck has a fixed amount of gold, silt, gem, and hazard cards.  As the players mine away the gold and the gems the silt and hazard cards are reshuffled into the deck meaning that mining at the beginning of the game will yield better results but as the years/game turns pass it gets harder and harder to pull the valuable mineral from the ground because there isn't as much left.

Eric managed to strike early and keep a good balance gold and gems and by the end of the game this won him the day.  Scott and Colten managed good strikes, Scott's was in gold and Colten's strategy was to wrest Gems from the ground.  Due to the difference in strategy Scott did edge out Colten in the final scoring tie break by having the most gold from a single mine.  Garrett and I found out the hard way that mining in the winter is unforgiving and can leaving nothing to show for all the effort but empty pockets and tears.
