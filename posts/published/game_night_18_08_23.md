For this game night the group played the game [Cyclades](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54998/cyclades) a 2009 release from Matagot, and two of it's expansions [Monuments](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/193215/cyclades-monuments) and [Titans](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/155820/cyclades-titans).  This is an area control dudes on a map game with an auction that will determine the actions available to the players for their actions each turn.

The game is set through the lens of a mythological view point of Greek Gods and Goddesses with all the fantastical creature cast you would expect from it's setting.  The five player board has 2 large islands and in setup Garrett and Wynn setup on the northern island while myself, Frank, and Scott decided the southern isle would make for a good starting spot.

Garrett quickly voted Wynn off their shared island giving him the run of the north island completely.  While Scott quietly was building up a very strong position on the East side of the southern island.  Scott was the first to put himself into a winning position on the board and was a single turn from building his final Metropolis.  Wynn and Frank decided that was a great time to move into Scott's already build Metropolis while sticking Medusa on his last territory effectively locking him into a single territory that he was unable to move from and taking him out of the game.  After that turn of events Garrett built his second Metropolis to win the game.
