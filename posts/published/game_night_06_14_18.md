On this game night, five game knights found themselves racing around the [Suzuka
Japan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/4937/formula-de-circuits-19-20-suzuka-melbourne),
[Formula De](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173/formula-de) race track number 19.

Formula De is a racing gaming that was released in 1991 and reprinted into
[Formula D](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37904/formula-d) in 2008.  I
knew Scott was bringing a brand new 3D printed dice tower to game night so I
wanted a dice game.  With Frank also coming I felt that a return of the Twonky
racing team of legend was appropriate with the dice chucking of Formula De.

So it was off to the races on the famously treacherous Sozuka circuit.  We set up
on the starting grid with Colten winning the roll for poll position, I was in
second, Frank in third, Garrett forth, and Scott fifth.  Colten got the quick
start out of pole position so was a gear ahead of the pack going into the first 
two corners.

There are two really tough areas of this track.  Coming out of turn two, the "S"
Curve, into Degner, turn three, is a 17 to 19 space straight away.  Then
coming out of turn 4, the Hairpin, into Spoon Curve, turn five is a 18 to 20
space straight away.

On the Formula De dice 5th gear has the numbers 11 to 20 and 6th gear is
numbered 21 to 30.  So rolling perfectly to shred the above corners is a small
chance probability, but feels great when lady luck is by your side.

On the first lap, no one made the correct roll from "S" Curve into Degner.  I
knew that making the jump from Hairpin into Spoon was crucial and took a chance
with 6th gear and landed way to deep into Spoon and came out of that corner with
my brakes on fire in cloud of tire smoke.  I didn't crash but I had to limp back
to the pits giving up the lead that my gamble had given me.

Sozuka took a toll on all the cars.  Scott was taking damage to the body of his
car.  Some engine points had been lost due to extreme down shifting and
unfortunate  redlining
rolls.  Frank made it out the pits first with a successful quick stop while the
rest of us had to get more major repairs complete.  Frank had a near perfect
second lap making both of the straightaway jumps.  Colten and I were really
close as the second lap started.  I made one of the jumps Colten missed.
Garrett and Scott were bringing up the back of the pack.  So we finished the
second and final lap of the race in the noted positions.

I know this Formula De a dice fest but there is some strategy in the question;
just how much risk are you willing to take?  This is a sentimental favorite of
mine.  As always, thanks guys for
playing.  Big thanks to Scott for the dice tower which he is endowing to the
Knights so we
have to make sure it makes to all the dice heavy game nights.
